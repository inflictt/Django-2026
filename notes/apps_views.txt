Django has two types of views:

Function Based View (FBV)

Class Based View (CBV)

Function Based View (FBV)
A function based view is a Python function.
It takes an HTTP request as input and returns an HTTP response.
The response can be:

a full web page

a text response

an error response

JSON or any HTTP response

All logic is written inside the function.

Example: views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

Create your views here.

def myfunction(request):
# logic is written here
return HttpResponse("Hello Django")

If you are using templates:

def home(request):
return render(request, "home.html")

urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app1 import views

urlpatterns = [
path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
path("", views.home, name="home"),
path("myfun/", views.myfunction, name="myfunction"),
]
