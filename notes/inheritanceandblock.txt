## Django Template Inheritance (WHY it comes first)

Template inheritance is **the very first concept** you should learn in Django templates because:

* It **prevents repetition** of HTML
* It enforces **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**
* It separates **layout** from **page-specific content**
* It makes large projects **manageable and scalable**

In real projects, **every page shares common parts**:

* `<head>`
* Navbar
* Footer
* Scripts
* Styles

Instead of writing these again and again, Django provides **template inheritance**.

## Base Template (Parent Template)

The **base template** acts like a **skeleton / structure** of your website.

It contains:

* Common HTML layout
* Reusable sections
* Placeholder areas for child templates

These placeholder areas are created using **block tags**.

Think of it as:

> “This is the fixed structure, child templates will fill the gaps.”

---

## `{% block %}` and `{% endblock %}` (Core Concept)

A **block** is a **replaceable section** in the parent template.

### What `{% block %}` does:

* Marks a section where child templates can inject content
* Acts like a **slot**

### What `{% endblock %}` does:

* Ends that replaceable section

So together:

```
block  → start of replaceable area
endblock → end of replaceable area
```

Without `endblock`, Django doesn’t know where the block ends.

---

## Rule: Blocks ALWAYS come in pairs

* Every `{% block %}` **must** have `{% endblock %}`
* Otherwise → **TemplateSyntaxError**

This is a **strict rule** of Django template language.

---

## Child Template (Inheritance Happens Here)

Child templates **inherit** from the parent template.

They do **not rewrite full HTML**.

Instead:

* They override only the blocks they need
* Everything else is reused automatically

Inheritance follows this hierarchy:

```
Parent (base.html)
   ↓
Child (home.html, about.html, course.html)
```

---

## Important Rules of Template Inheritance

### 1. `{% extends %}` must be the FIRST line

No HTML, no spaces, no text before it.

Why?
Because Django must know:

> “Which template am I inheriting from?”

If it’s not first → Django throws an error.

---

### 2. Blocks are defined in parent, overridden in child

* Parent → defines blocks
* Child → fills blocks

Child templates **do not create new structure**, they only **customize content**.

---

### 3. Same block name connects parent and child

Inheritance works using **block names**.

If parent has:

```
block content
```

Child must override:

```
block content
```

Different names = no connection.

---

## Why Django Enforces This Design

This strict structure gives:

* Clean architecture
* Predictable rendering
* Easy debugging
* Team-friendly templates

It avoids:

* Messy HTML duplication
* Inconsistent layouts
* Copy-paste bugs

---

## Mental Model (Easy to Remember)

* **Base template** = Blueprint
* **Blocks** = Empty rooms
* **Child template** = Furniture placed inside rooms

Rooms already exist — you only decorate them.

---

## Summary (Exam-Ready)

* Template inheritance is the **foundation** of Django templates
* `{% block %}` defines replaceable sections
* `{% endblock %}` closes the section
* Blocks must always be paired
* `{% extends %}` must be the very first line
* Parent defines structure, child defines content
* This keeps code reusable, clean, and scalable
