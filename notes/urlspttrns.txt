This is the main `urls.py` file of the **ch8 project**.

`urlpatterns` is a list that connects URLs (routes) to views.

Basic syntax of a path:

`path('route/', which_view_to_call, kwargs, name)`

Example:

* `'route/'` → the URL the user types
* `view` → which function or class-based view should run
* `kwargs` → optional extra arguments (rarely used)
* `name` → used for URL reversing

Currently, we are writing **URLs of multiple apps (app1, app2, app3, etc.) inside the main project’s `urls.py` file**.
This approach is okay for **very small projects**, but it is **not a good practice for bigger or scalable projects**.

To overcome this problem, we create a **separate `urls.py` file inside each app**.

Example:

* `app1/urls.py` → contains only app1 URLs
* `app2/urls.py` → contains only app2 URLs

Then we **include** these app URLs inside the project’s main `urls.py`.

This approach is better because:

* Code becomes clean and organized
* Each app is independent
* If we want to reuse an app, we can simply **copy-paste the entire app folder** into another project without touching the main URLs much

This is the **recommended and standard Django practice**.
