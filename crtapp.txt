Project is the parent and apps are its children.

steps

create a new folder
mkdir new_folder

create virtual environment
virtualenv venv

activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

create django project
django-admin startproject project_name

go inside project folder (outer root directory)
cd project_name

run server to check
python manage.py runserver

till here, the project is ready.

condition before creating an app

virtual environment must be activated

you must be in the outer root directory (where manage.py exists)

syntax to create an app
python manage.py startapp app1

about app1 folder

init.py → makes the folder a python package

migrations/

init.py → stores database migration files

admin.py → used to register models so CRUD operations can be performed from Django admin panel

apps.py → app configuration

models.py → used to create database tables

tests.py → used for testing

views.py → contains logic for handling requests and responses

till here, the app is created but it is NOT yet recognised by the django project.

to make django recognise the app, we must register it inside the project settings.

steps to register app

open
project_name/settings.py

go to INSTALLED_APPS list and add the app name:

app1

(or recommended way)

app1.apps.App1Config

after this, django knows about the app and it can be used for models, views, admin, migrations, etc.

now the app is properly installed and connected to the django project.
